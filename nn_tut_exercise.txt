I don't agree with the statement, because even as we think we understand how the brain works and the basics of how neurons in the brain are connected but theres so much to the brain that we still don't understand. Even if we can replace each biological neuron with an artificial one, we can't be sure that the interactions within the brain and all the functions our brain can perform will be replicated completely and correctly. What is the activation function of a human neuron? Are they the same for each neuron? I don't think we are at the technological stage which brain emulation can be achieved.

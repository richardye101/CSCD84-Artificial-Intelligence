idea 1:
- run BFS for the cats to mouse, store path length as c_i for each ith cat
- run BFS for the mouse to cheese, store path length as m 

Let the mean of c_i be cbar

The utility will be some function of these distances.
I will use a negative cubic which gives larger utilities when m is smaller, and larger values when m is larger
I will shift it to the right by 10, and divide by 3 (as a start)

I will add cbar, which means the further the mouse is on average to the cat, the higher the utility.

utility = -[ (m-10)/3 ]^3 + cbar

	CSC D84 - Unit 3 - Reinforcement Learning
	
	This file contains stubs for implementing the Q-Learning method
	for reinforcement learning as discussed in lecture. You have to
	complete two versions of Q-Learning.
	
	* Standard Q-Learning, based on a full-state representation and
	  a large Q-Table
	* Feature based Q-Learning to handle problems too big to allow
	  for a full-state representation
	    
	Read the assignment handout carefully, then implement the
	required functions below. Sections where you have to add code
	are marked

	**************
	*** TO DO:
	**************

	If you add any helper functions, make sure you document them
	properly and indicate in the report.txt file what you added.
	
	Have fun!

	DO NOT FORGET TO 'valgrind' YOUR CODE - We will check for pointer
	management being done properly, and for memory leaks.

	Starter code: F.J.E. Jan. 16

{
 /*
   This function implementes the Q-Learning update as stated in Lecture. It 
   receives as input a <s,a,r,s'> tuple, and updates the Q-table accordingly.
   
   Your work here is to calculate the required update for the Q-table entry
   for state s, and apply it to the Q-table
     
   The update involves two constants, alpha and lambda, which are defined in QLearn.h - you should not 
   have to change their values. Use them as they are.
     
   Details on how states are used for indexing into the QTable are shown
   below, in the comments for QLearn_action. Be sure to read those as well!

int QLearn_action(double gr[max_graph_size][4], int mouse_pos[1][2], int cats[5][2], int cheeses[5][2], double pct, double *QTable, int size_X, int graph_size)
{
  /*
     This function decides the action the mouse will take. It receives as inputs
     - The graph - so you can check for walls! The mouse must never move through walls
     - The mouse position
     - The cat position
     - The chees position
     - A 'pct' value in [0,1] indicating the amount of time the mouse uses the QTable to decide its action,
       for example, if pct=.25, then 25% of the time the mouse uses the QTable to choose its action,
       the remaining 75% of the time it chooses randomly among the available actions.
       
     Remember that the training process involves random exploration initially, but as training
     proceeds we use the QTable more and more, in order to improve our QTable values around promising
     actions.
     
     The value of pct is controlled by QLearn_core_GL, and increases with each round of training.
     
     This function *must return* an action index in [0,3] where
        0 - move up
        1 - move right
        2 - move down
        3 - move left
        
     QLearn_core_GL will print a warning if your action makes the mouse cross a wall, or if it makes
     the mouse leave the map - this should not happen. If you see a warning, fix the code in this
     function!
     
   The Q-table has been pre-allocated and initialized to 0. The Q-table has
   a size of
   
        graph_size^3 x 4
        
   This is because the table requires one entry for each possible state, and
   the state is comprised of the position of the mouse, cat, and cheese. 
   Since each of these agents can be in one of graph_size positions, all
   possible combinations yield graph_size^3 states.
   
   Now, for each state, the mouse has up to 4 possible moves (up, right,
   down, and left). We ignore here the fact that some moves are not possible
   from some states (due to walls) - it is up to the QLearn_action() function
   to make sure the mouse never crosses a wall. 
   
   So all in all, you have a big table.
        
   For example, on an 8x8 maze, the Q-table will have a size of
   
       64^3 x 4  entries
       
       with 
       
       size_X = 8		<--- size of one side of the maze
       graph_size = 64		<--- Total number of nodes in the graph
       
   Indexing within the Q-table works as follows:
   
     say the mouse is at   i,j
         the cat is at     k,l
         the cheese is at  m,n
         
     state = (i+(j*size_X)) + ((k+(l*size_X))*graph_size) + ((m+(n*size_X))*graph_size*graph_size)
     ** Make sure you undestand the state encoding above!
     
     Entries in the Q-table for this state are

     *(QTable+(4*state)+a)      <-- here a is the action in [0,3]
     
     (yes, it's a linear array, no shorcuts with brackets!)
     
     NOTE: There is only one cat and once cheese, so you only need to use cats[0][:] and cheeses[0][:]

    action given the current policy.
    
    E.g. if 'pct' is .15, then 15% of the time the function uses the current weights and chooses
    the optimal action. The remaining 85% of the time, a random action is chosen.
    
    As before, the mouse must never select an action that causes it to walk through walls or leave
    the maze.

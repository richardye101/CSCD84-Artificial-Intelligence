Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. 

           Copy/paste the reported classification rates for: 

           Training data (last training round): 0.880987

           Testing data: 0.882895

2 .- (1 marks) Repeat the process using the hyperbolic tangent activation
           function.

           Training data (last training round): 0.910566

           Testing data: 0.912037

3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
           results? which one learned faster?

        The hyperbolic tangent activation yielded the best classification results.
        Both learned very quickly at 250 epochs, although tank was slightly faster.

4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).

              Training data (last training round): 0.984998

              Testing data: 0.973949
	       
5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

              Training data (last training round): 0.927256

              Testing data: 0.928189
	       
6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead

              Training data (last training round): 0.672221

              Testing data: 0.685018

7 .- (3 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 

	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?

         The network performs better with 150 hidden units compared to 10.
         However, the accuracy difference between 150 and 10 is much smaller than the difference between 10 and 3 hidden units.
         This tells me that 3 features in the hidden layer is too little information to accurately label the input.

8 .- (3 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used: 785

	       Classification rate on testing data: 0.979284

9 .- (3 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		- Describe the error function
		- How many layers should you use?

We could use a neural network as the policy for RL-based cat and mouse game.
In order to avoid having to enumerate the state-space, we could use the actor-critic RL method.

The inputs to the network would consist of:
 - The current mouse position (1 bit out of rows * cols),
 - cat positions (rows * cols),
 - cheese positions (cheeses * rows * cols),
If this input is too large to practically train the network,
then one could send an image of the maze with all entities to the network, which could be a CNN.

The output layer would have 4 neurons where each would correspond to one of 4 possible actions (up left down right).

The error function could be simple MSE, where the target action is the action that leads to the state with the highest predicted value.

The network likely should use at least 2 layers, to gain some nuanced understanding of the game's dynamics.
The answer to this question would ultimately arise via experimentation though.

The actor (policy/neural network in question) and critic (another, simpler state-value NN) would learn in unision to find a good approach to the cat and mouse game.

/*
	CSC D84 - Unit 4 - Neural Networks
	
	This file contains stubs for implementing your Neural Nets classifier.
	
	You will implement a single layer network, and 2-layer network,
	and you will study what is the effect of having different numbers
	of neurons in the network, as well as what happens when you used
	different sigmoid functions.
	    
	Read the assignment handout carefully, then implement the
	required functions below. Sections where you have to add code
	are marked

	**************
	*** TO DO:
	**************

	If you add any helper functions, make sure you document them
	properly and indicate in the report.txt file what you added.
	
	Have fun!

	DO NOT FORGET TO 'valgrind' YOUR CODE - We will check for pointer
	management being done properly, and for memory leaks.

	Starter code: F.J.E. Feb. 16
